# Tree Classification in Ponta Delgada vs Stirling  

### Introduction:

***
  
Classification is a machine learning model used to predict mutually exclusive categories when there are no continuous values. It does so by using labels to classify data, thus predicting a discrete number of values.  

With this in mind, the following Contextual Image Classification Project aims to develop a model that recognizes and correctly classifies trees in an urban context.  

The two cities used are:  
• City A: Ponta Delgada, São Miguel, Azores, PT
• City B: Stirling, Scotland, UK
