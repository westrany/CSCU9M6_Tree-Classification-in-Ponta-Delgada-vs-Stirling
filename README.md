# Tree Classification in Ponta Delgada vs Stirling  

_Note: the following project is and academic assignment part of my Data Science Bachelor's at the University of Stirling._

### Introduction:

Classification is a machine learning model used to predict mutually exclusive categories when there are no continuous values. It does so by using labels to classify data, thus predicting a discrete number of values.  

With this in mind, the following Contextual Image Classification Project aims to develop a model that recognizes and correctly classifies trees in an urban context.  

To better train the module, two different cities (A and B) were chosen to increase diversity and train the model to incorporate and recognise a larger scope of trees.

The two cities used are:  
• City A: Ponta Delgada, São Miguel, Azores, PT  
• City B: Stirling, Scotland, UK
